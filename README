vikitasks is a distributed todo lists manager. It provides a quick 
overview of priority/task lists maintained in several viki files. 
Depending on your settings, you can quickly search all "homepages" 
of intervikis or search only project-specific files. Buffers 
containing task lists are added to the list of vikitasks. There is 
also an option to view a list of current tasks on startup.


Usage:
    :VikiTasks[!] [CONSTRAINT] [PATTERN] [FILE_PATTERNS]


Features:
    - Collect tasks from viki's priority lists (see |viki-tasks|)
    - Sort those tasks
    - Browse tasks with a given date
    - Optionally browse all tasks (incl. those without a date)


Let's say you have the files:

foo.txt: >
    * Foo
        #A 2009-12-13 Do this
        #C 2009-12-20 :call @Anna What was it she wanted to tell me?
        #A Whatever

bar.txt: >
    * Bar
        #C 2009-12-24 :call @Bernie Wish him good luck
        #D 2009-11-01 Do that

Let's assume you have added both files to |g:vikitasks#files|. Switch to 
the buffer foo.txt and call >

    :VikiTasks!

and you get the following list: >

    Bar.txt|2| #D 2009-11-01 Do that
    Foo.txt|2| #A 2009-12-13 Do this
    Foo.txt|3| #C 2009-12-20 Call @Anna
    Bar.txt|3| #C 2009-12-24 Wish @Bernie good luck

If you do/had done this on the 15 December 2009, the third line would be 
highlighted, i.e. the entries above the cursor refer to passed/missed 
events. If you had called :VikiTasks! (behold the bang), then the 
"Whatever" entry would have been included in the list too.

If you had called >
    
    :VikiTasks current

only the first two items would be listed.

This week's tasks (i.e. the tasks that should be accomplished today or 
within the following six days) could be listed with >
    
    :VikiTasks 6
